This plugin is not affiliated with Postlight in any way. I just loved how simple their AMP process was and decided to build this simple plugin for anyone to use it.

== Installation ==

Simply install and sit back.  No configuration required.

1. Upload `mercury-amp.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
